# GreatVines Coding Challenge

This basic application demonstrates several api calls to Salesforce.  A decision was made to keep this very low level and not use any libraries or servers with the exception of the http-server package that is used to deliver the two static .html files, index.html and login.html.  Everything else is straight up HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Installation
